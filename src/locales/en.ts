  backgroundInfo: 'I believe that more than two decades of experience in education and coaching, as well as strong management skills, have signicantly contributed to the academic and practical advancement of my field of work. Efficiency, commitment, enthusiasm, and high motivation are my main characteristics. My ability to establish effective communication with colleagues and learners, problem-solving skills, exceptional management techniques, and performance evaluation capabilities have paved the way for success in the fields of education, coaching, and management.
